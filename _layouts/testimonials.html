      <p class="testimonial-text">I have ordered several times and I've yet to be disappointed. My two favorites right now are the chocolate pie… y’all it's like a dark chocolate slice of heaven… and the Oreo truffles. Sidenote here, I don't like Oreos, nasty little things, but Sweet Poteat Oreo truffles are my guilty pleasure.</p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">That Dutch apple pie was INCREDIBLE. I may have to take you up on teaching me because I could spend hundreds every month just to keep a piece on hand.</p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">Teisha makes the best treats. I have too many favorites to list them all, but my top two would be the snickerdoodles and the peanut butter cookies. They are so soft and moist. You can even get the peanut butter cookies with a chocolate kiss on top for added deliciousness.</p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">Sweet Poteat has the most delicious treats! I am a chocolate fiend and Teisha's chocolate pie is the most enviable I've ever had. It didn't even last 24 hours in our house! The cookies are so delicious.  She has truly mastered the crunch to chewy ratio. Definitely recommend Sweet Poteat; it's worth every penny. </p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">Teisha is such a creative and wonderful baker of all kinds of yummy treats! We have particularly enjoyed purchasing her chocolate pie for Thanksgiving day! It was a winner! We also love her chocolate Oreo truffles. She's the girl to contact for treats to serve on special holidays and occasions!</p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">Sweet Poteat treats are always so delicious! There is obviously a lot of care and love put into every bite. The buttercream frosting is fluffy and light, with the right amount of sweetness. The truffles are the perfect size, and the pies are so yummy! Everything I've had from Sweet Poteat has been the best quality hand meditation as possible. Five stars!</p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">Sweet Poteat’s Oreo pie was fantastic! It was a good treat for the entire family. We enjoyed the Oreo crust and the Oreo crumbles on top. And the cream was great too. I would purchase again.</p>

      <p class="testimonial-text">I have loved everything I have tried from Sweet Poteat. I have never liked chocolate pie, but I had seconds with Teisha’s chocolate pie! My orders are always ready on time and look beautiful. Teisha is easy to work with and fun to talk to. I highly recommend everything she makes.</p>
