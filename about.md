    <p class="about-text">I have loved treats since before I can remember! Brownies were always a staple at our house when I was growing up. And my step dad used to bake delicious oatmeal chocolate chip cookies when I was little. My mom made the most incredible truffles at Christmas time. Honestly, sneaking treats was one of my favorite pastimes.</p>
    <p class="about-text">When I got married, I wanted so badly to bake a really good chocolate chip cookie. But being completely naive, I assumed you could leave out the oats from my step dadâ€™s oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe. Of course, that ended in tears and disaster. From that moment on, I was determined to learn to bake.</p>
    <p class="about-text">My friend Abby began to show me the ropes. Cookies, pies, breads. She taught me some basics, and fed me enough delicious baked goods to keep my fire burning. I began to really focus on chocolate chip cookies, since they were my favorite. I tried recipe after recipe, technique after technique. When I was finally satisfied with all that I learned, I created my own recipe. Then I moved on to truffles and pies and bars. </p>
    <p class="about-text">In 2019 we were pregnant with our fourth and our budget was feeling tight. My friend Stacy encouraged me to sell my treats. I decided to sell pies at Thanksgiving and sold 16 pies. Then for Christmas, I sold even more treat boxes. In Spring of 2020, I decided to get serious and created Sweet Poteat Homemade Treats. </p>
    <p class="about-text"> Today I sell a LOT of treats around the holidays, cater family reunions, make treat favors for parties, showers and weddings, and take orders for birthdays, events and cravings. </p>
